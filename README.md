# VSCode Webview React (+ esbuild, + tachyons, + web server)

This project was forked from [rebornix/vscode-webview-react](https://rebornix/vscode-webview-react) originally, then updated to have modern React dependencies, removed all mentions of CRA and other scripts, to include a custom script to build assets using [ESbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild). I then added in [tachyons](https://tachyons.io) to deal with styling, and [Modern Web's dev server](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web) to handle quick refresh when developing. CSS already works out of the box with ESbuild but could be extended with post-css or something in the future.
